# RustyPages

RustyPages is an experimental static site generator written in Rust, focused on speed, simplicity, and full control over content generation. The goal is to build a reliable SSG that prioritizes simplicity and developer experience.

## 🚧 Project Status

**Very Early Stage.** This project is in its initial development phase. Expect rapid changes, incomplete features, and active experimentation. Contributions are welcome, but please understand that the project is still forming its core design and philosophy.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 🚀 Fast build times with a Rust-powered core
- 📦 Minimal dependencies for predictable and lean binaries
- 🛠️ Fine-grained control over page generation
- 📄 Markdown-based content with flexible theming
- 🧪 Solid testability and clean architecture

## 💡 Why?

Most static site generators either go for simplicity and sacrifice flexibility, or offer too many features at the cost of performance. RustyPages aims to strike the balance — a lean core, extensible components, and blazing speed powered by Rust.

## 📌 Roadmap Overview

- [ ] Basic CLI scaffolding
- [ ] Parse Markdown into HTML
- [ ] Template rendering support (e.g., handlebars or tera)
- [ ] File watching and hot-reloading
- [ ] Theme system
- [ ] Deployment helpers

Stay tuned and follow along as this project takes shape.
